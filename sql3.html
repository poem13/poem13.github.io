                    <h2>Manufacturing Parts</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Given a real world scenario to monitor a manufacturing process, I had to determine the acceptable heights for the manufacturing parts.</p>
                <p>I first created a window function to be reused, and a subquery that had ROW_NUMBER (unique identifier within the window), and determined the average height and standard deviation for the height!</b></p>
                <pre>SELECT
		a.*,
		avg_height + 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS ucl,
		avg_height - 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS lcl
	FROM(
		SELECT
			operator,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS row_number,
			height,
			AVG(height) OVER w AS avg_height,
			STDDEV(height) OVER w AS stddev_height
		FROM public.manufacturing_parts

		WINDOW w AS (
			PARTITION BY operator
			ORDER BY item_no
			ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)) AS a
                </pre>
                <h4>Calculating the Acceptable Range...</h4>
                <p>Using statistical approach, I calculated the upper and lower control limit using these formulas below:</p>
                <img src="images/stat.png" height="72" width="274"/>
                <p>I then put the subquery I created into another query that calculated the UCL and LCL</p>
                <pre>SELECT
		a.*,
		avg_height + 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS ucl,
		avg_height - 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS lcl
	FROM(
		SELECT
			operator,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS row_number,
			height,
			AVG(height) OVER w AS avg_height,
			STDDEV(height) OVER w AS stddev_height
		FROM public.manufacturing_parts

		WINDOW w AS (
			PARTITION BY operator
			ORDER BY item_no
			ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)) AS a
                </pre>

                <h4>Using Conditionals...</h4>
                <p>I then used a CASE station to check if it is in that acceptable range and I created an alert. This is the overall query below:</p>
                <pre>SELECT
	b.*,
	CASE
		WHEN b.height NOT BETWEEN b.lcl AND b.ucl THEN TRUE
		ELSE FALSE
	END AS alert
FROM
	(SELECT
		a.*,
		avg_height + 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS ucl,
		avg_height - 3 * a.stddev_height/sqrt(5) AS lcl
	FROM(
		SELECT
			operator,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS row_number,
			height,
			AVG(height) OVER w AS avg_height,
			STDDEV(height) OVER w AS stddev_height
		FROM public.manufacturing_parts

		WINDOW w AS (
			PARTITION BY operator
			ORDER BY item_no
			ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)) AS a
	WHERE a.row_number >= 5
	) AS b;
                </pre>
                <p>I created an alert that will flag whether the height of the product is in the control limits for each operator. This will be useful in real world scenarios where there will be checks in SQL!</p>
